# led-patterns-controller

## Introduction

This software is developed using C# and Arduino. This allows users to turn on-off a desired bulb, as well as create different types of light patterns, with the help of software, without physically intervening with the device. Here users don't need to find the connected Com Port type separately. They only need to select the relevant Com Port type and Baund Rate. While designing it, it is designed in such a way that the possible errors by the users are minimized to the maximum extent.
