# 💡 Bulb Control and Light Pattern Software

### 📋 Overview

This project allows users to remotely control a light bulb. The software provides functionality to turn the bulb on/off and generate various light patterns without physical intervention. It simplifies user interaction by automating **COM Port Detection** and minimizing errors.

### ✨ Features

- **Remote Control**: Turn the light bulb on or off via the software.
- **Light Pattern Creation**: Apply custom light patterns.
- **Automated COM Port Detection**: Automatically detects the connected COM port and Baud rate for the user.
- **Error Minimization**: User-friendly design aimed at reducing possible errors during operation.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- **C#**: Frontend and control logic.
- **Arduino**: Microcontroller for hardware interfacing.
- **Serial Communication**: Data transfer between the C# application and Arduino.

### 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/denuwan-yasodhana/ChromaDazzle.git
    ```

2. Open the project in **Visual Studio** and load the provided Arduino code into the **Arduino IDE**.

3. Connect the Arduino device to your computer.

4. Ensure the required libraries are installed in both C# and Arduino.

### 🚀 Usage

1. Run the C# application.
2. Select the appropriate **COM port** and **Baud rate** from the dropdown list.
3. Control the bulb using the **On/Off** buttons or Select a light pattern from the options.

### 🌱 Future Improvements

- Add more complex light pattern options.
- Implement wireless control using **Wi-Fi** or **Bluetooth**.
- Enhance the user interface for an improved user experience.
